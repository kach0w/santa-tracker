# Santa Tracker 2022
- For the Holidays I wanted to build something related to Christmas
- Using the <a href="https://www.geoapify.com">Geoapify</a> API I was able to create a map with markers 
- Then I could ask the user for their location and use a JSON file to randomly select a city out of the biggest cities in the US and update the map every 10 seconds
- It seems to be working well and it is mostly done except for some possible ui changes
